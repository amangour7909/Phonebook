# Auto-Suggestion feature in PhoneBook
This Phonebook Web Application has a helpful feature you've probably seen on many websites before â€“ Auto Suggestion. 
Even though it's common, I have made it super easy to use.
With this feature, when you start typing a phone number, it'll suggest contacts, just like you've seen elsewhere. 
This makes it a breeze to find and manage your contacts, making your life simpler and more organized.

To implement this feature i had implemented trie data structure.

# Features-
Duplicate and Invalid Phone Numbers
The application employs the Trie data structure to ensure that there are no duplicate phone numbers in your phonebook.

It also checks for invalid phone numbers and prevents their insertion.

Sorting Contacts
The Trie data structure is used to sort contacts based on their phone numbers. This makes it easy to find and manage your contacts.
